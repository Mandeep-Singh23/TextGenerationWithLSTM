## Overview

This project harnesses the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate text, providing a fascinating peek into the realm of natural language generation. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns patterns from a corpus of text data and generates new text that mirrors the style and structure of the original dataset.

## Features

- **LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes LSTM neural networks for sequential data processing.
- **Flexible Input**: Compatible with various text datasets, allowing for versatility in content generation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust hyperparameters such as sequence length, batch size, and training epochs for optimal results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless text generation.
- **State-of-the-Art Text Generation**: Produce coherent and contextually relevant text passages.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mandeep-Singh23/TextGenerationWithLSTM.git

```
## Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure your text corpus is formatted appropriately for training.

- **Train the model**: Run the training script to train the LSTM model on your dataset.

- **Generate Text**: Once trained, use the model to generate new text passages.

## Weights
-  **Small LSTM**: weights for smaller LSTM model is named as 'weights-improvment-20-1.9774.hdf5'
- **Large LSTM**: weights for smaller LSTM model is named as 'weights-improvement-bigger-40-1.2682.hdf5'

## Corpus
- The file **wonderland.txt** is also uplaoded.
